# Codedex-Hackathon-2024

As a team, we created a website utilizing Vite and React from scratch to unite the community for Chelsea's Stoop Sale! We included a countdown timer letting the people know when the event will be going on. Additionally, we placed a share button allowing people to push this forward to their social media. Further down in the page, we put a sneak peek at what is going to be sold at the sale as a hook! Also, we included a map showing where the event is located. All this is wrapped up with an FAQ clearing up people's concerns.
